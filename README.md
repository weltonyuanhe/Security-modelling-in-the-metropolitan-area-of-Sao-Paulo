# Security-modelling-in-the-metropolitan-area-of-Sao-Paulo
The issue of public security is a challenge for Brazilian society, and crime is a major concern
for the most populous state in the country, S達o Paulo. It is always desirable for the public
administration to model and predict criminal trends, taking into account historical dates and the
georeferencing of each municipality, meaning latitude and longitude. In this context, the use
of spatiotemporal models to explain the relationship between predictors and crimes, as well as
considering location, can be of great importance. One possible model is Spatial Autoregressive
(SAR) modeling, which takes into account covariates and implicit spatial dependencies. In this
work, based on the number of crimes, SAR modeling is used to describe and model the cities
in the metropolitan region of S達o Paulo, Brazil, including the annual seasonality observed in
the data. To visualize the data and develop modeling with the spatial neighborhood matrix, R
packages such as spatialreg are used. The Lasso method is used to pre-select variables with
greater significance, such as the number of inhabitants per household, the dropout rate, and
the public elementary school dropout rate in the early years. Then, the SAR model is applied
to include spatial information and enhance crime modeling. In general, this work focuses on
developing spatiotemporal modeling for crimes in the state of S達o Paulo, identifying predictor
variables that influence the quantity of crimes in a given municipality. In addition to the SAR
model, artificial neural networks, such as multilayer models and Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM), are also used in the research, and compared with the SAR model. The goal of this
dissertation is to develop predictive modeling considering spatiotemporal data for crimes in the
metropolitan region of S達o Paulo, using predictor variables that influence the occurrence and
quantity of crimes in a particular municipality. It is expected that the obtained results are useful
for decision making by public administration, since the work creates a method to analyze crime
patterns in a specific municipality, and also helps the city improve security issues through various
social factors.
